LexRobotics R&D Repository
==========================

---

Hello! You're now in the "Research and Development" code repository 
(shared between Two Bits and Parity Bits), where we develop "advanced" 
(whatever that means) stuff not necessarily related to the robot. 
Not even necessarily in ROBOTC or even vaguely connectable to the team.

A lot of the stuff is actually extremely relevant to the actual robot, 
and will quite possibly end up being copied to the main Git repo. However, 
this repo will retain everything, even between seasons.

Guidelines
----------

Naturally, you should be nice about how you use git, 
and not reset other people's changes, etc.

Additionally, there is a very simple header-comment format to help people 
understand what you're doing (or _trying_ to do).

At the top of each file, you need something like this:

```
/*
[file name]
[one-line explanation of what it does]

LastUpdatedOn: [date]
LastUpdatedBy: [name]
Status: [status - final scrim copy, compiles but untested, just started, etc.]
*/


/* HOW TO USE IT
[instructions on all functions, etc.]

[any other notes: bugs, caveats, dependencies, etc. that might be good to know]
*/

//Code starts here.
```

See any files in the repo for examples.

Other than that, **happy hacking**!
